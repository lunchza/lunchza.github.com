What follows is a link to various Java projects I have worked on since I started my degree. A few of them were programming assignments that I was given, but most are personal projects, usually written to fulfill a specific need. They are listed in no particular order.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: A few of these were coded during my first year of study, and as such may contain code of questionable quality.\r\n\r\n# List of projects\r\n* [Game of Life](http://lunchza.github.com/Game-of-Life/)\r\n                      -An implementation of Conway's Game of Life\r\n\r\n* [JFormCreator](http://lunchza.github.com/JFormCreator)\r\n                      -A drag-and-drop form creator for Java\r\n\r\n* [Drug Lord](http://lunchza.github.com/Drug-Lord/)\r\n                      -Recreation of an old classic\r\n\r\n* [tIDE](http://lunchza.github.com/tIDE/)\r\n                      -A full IDE (Editor, Assembler, Disassembler, Virtual Machine) for the t programming language\r\n\r\n* [Series Organiser](http://lunchza.github.com/Series-Organiser/)\r\n                      -Organises your series folders by enforcing filename consistency\r\n\r\n* [Steve Chat](http://lunchza.github.com/Steve-Chat/)\r\n                      -IRC-clone (Server and client)\r\n\r\n* SimpleBots(Page coming soon)\r\n                      -Pit simple programmable bots against each other in a user-made arena\r\n\r\n* [VisualHDD](http://lunchza.github.com/VisualHDD/)\r\n                      -Generates a visual representation of the contents of your hard drive","name":"lunchza.github.com","google":""}
